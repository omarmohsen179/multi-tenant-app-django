The error message you're encountering suggests two issues:

1. **Line Ending Warning**: The warning about line endings (`LF will be replaced by CRLF`) is due to differences in line endings between Unix-based systems (LF) and Windows (CRLF). This is a common issue when working across different operating systems.

2. **Submodule Error**: The error `'frontend/' does not have a commit checked out` indicates that the `frontend` directory is likely a Git submodule, and it hasn't been initialized or updated properly.

Here's how you can address these issues:

### Fixing Line Ending Warning

To address the line ending warning, you can configure Git to handle line endings appropriately:

1. **Set Git to Automatically Handle Line Endings**:

   Run the following command to set Git to automatically convert line endings:

   ```bash
   git config --global core.autocrlf true
   ```

   This setting will convert LF to CRLF when checking out text files on Windows, and convert CRLF to LF when committing.

2. **Re-add the File**:

   If the warning persists, you can force Git to re-add the file with the correct line endings:

   ```bash
   git rm --cached entrypoint.sh
   git add entrypoint.sh
   ```

### Fixing Submodule Error

To resolve the submodule error, you need to initialize and update the submodule:

1. **Initialize and Update Submodules**:

   Run the following commands to initialize and update the submodule:

   ```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

2. **Check Submodule Status**:

   Verify the status of the submodule to ensure it's properly checked out:

   ```bash
   git submodule status
   ```

3. **Add Submodule Changes**:

   If there are changes in the submodule, you can add them:

   ```bash
   git add frontend
   ```

After performing these steps, try running `git add .` again to see if the issues are resolved. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for more help!
